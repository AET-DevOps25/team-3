**Problem Statement**
---------------------

Most Uni courses distribute their learning material through slides or transcripts which are often tedious to follow and lack interactive learning principles. In order to maximize the learning effect for students we aim to design a solution that turns static course content into an interactive learning experience.

Our tool turns passive lecture slides and transcripts into an **interactive study companion.**

### **Main Functionality**

*   **Slide Upload**: Users can upload lecture slides (PDF, PPT, etc.).
    
*   **Summaries**: The tool auto-generates clear, concise summaries of the material.
    
*   **Quiz & Test Generation**: Automatic creation of quizzes and practice tests to reinforce learning.
    
*   **Flashcards**: Key concepts and terms are transformed into flashcards for revision.
    
*   **Chatbot**: An interactive chatbot allows students to ask questions and clarify concepts directly within the app.
    

### **Intended Users**

**University and College Students**: The main audience, especially those who:

*   Missed lectures and need to catch up.
    
*   Want to prepare more actively for exams.
    
*   Prefer interactive study methods.
    

**Tutors/Educators**: To generate assessments and learning aids quickly.

### **GenAI Integration**

We plan to integrate GenAI meaningfully in the following ways:

*   **Natural Language Processing**: To summarize slides and break down complex concepts into easy-to-understand language.
    
*   **Question Generation**: Using AI to create varied and insightful quiz questions and flashcards.
    
*   **Conversational AI**: A chatbot that understands and responds to user questions based on the uploaded material.
    
*   **Adaptive Learning**: The AI could learn from usersâ€™ quiz results and recommend further study areas.
    

### **Example Scenarios**

*   **Missed a Class**: A student uploads slides from a missed lecture and instantly receives a summary, a quiz, and flashcards to catch up quickly.
    
*   **Exam Preparation**: A student uploads several weeks of slides and practices with a comprehensive test generated by the tool, then clarifies doubts by chatting with the AI assistant.
    
*   **Daily Review**: After a lecture, the student uploads the slides and uses flashcards to reinforce key points regularly.
