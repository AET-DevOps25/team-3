The human body has four primary tissue types, each with specialized functions and characteristics. These are:

1. Epithelial Tissue
Function: Covers body surfaces, lines cavities and organs, and forms glands.

Characteristics:

Tightly packed cells with minimal extracellular matrix.

Avascular (lacks blood vessels) but innervated.

Rapid cell division and regeneration.

Polarity: has an apical (free) surface and a basal surface attached to a basement membrane.

Types:

a. By layers:
Simple epithelium – single layer (e.g., alveoli in lungs).

Stratified epithelium – multiple layers (e.g., skin).

Pseudostratified epithelium – appears layered but isn’t (e.g., respiratory tract).

b. By shape:
Squamous – flat and thin.

Cuboidal – cube-shaped.

Columnar – tall and column-like.

Transitional – changes shape (e.g., bladder lining).

Examples:

Skin epidermis (stratified squamous).

Intestinal lining (simple columnar).

Kidney tubules (simple cuboidal).

2. Connective Tissue
Function: Supports, binds, and protects organs; stores energy; provides immunity.

Characteristics:

Abundant extracellular matrix (fibers and ground substance).

Vascular (varies by type).

Includes cells like fibroblasts, adipocytes, macrophages, mast cells.

Types:

a. Connective Tissue Proper
Loose connective tissue (e.g., areolar, adipose).

Dense connective tissue (e.g., tendons, ligaments).

b. Specialized Connective Tissues
Cartilage (hyaline, elastic, fibrocartilage) – avascular, flexible.

Bone – rigid, mineralized.

Blood – fluid matrix (plasma), transports cells and nutrients.

Lymph – fluid involved in immune responses.

Examples:

Fat tissue (adipose).

Bone marrow.

Tendons and ligaments.

3. Muscle Tissue
Function: Produces movement via contraction.

Characteristics:

Excitable and contractile.

Contains actin and myosin filaments.

Highly vascular.

Types:

Skeletal muscle – voluntary, striated, multinucleated, attached to bones.

Cardiac muscle – involuntary, striated, intercalated discs, found in the heart.

Smooth muscle – involuntary, non-striated, found in walls of organs and vessels.

Examples:

Biceps (skeletal).

Heart wall (cardiac).

Intestinal wall (smooth).

4. Nervous Tissue
Function: Transmits electrical signals; coordinates body functions.

Characteristics:

Excitable and conductive.

Poor regenerative ability (especially in the CNS).

Components:

Neurons – transmit signals.

Neuroglia (glial cells) – support, protect, and nourish neurons.

Examples:

Brain.

Spinal cord.

Peripheral nerves.
